## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Back-end**: PHP (procedural)
- **Database**: MySQL (via phpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: Apache (XAMPP)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

- Input sanitization using `mysqli_real_escape_string`
- Basic session-based login authentication
- Passwords can be upgraded to **hashed** versions using `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`
- Prevents vote repetition via controlled navigation (you can expand this logic)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/exe-walt/online-voting-system.git](https://github.com/exe-walt/Voting-System-Project.git)
```

### 2. Set up the Database
- Create a database named `onlinevoting` in phpMyAdmin.
- Import your SQL dump file (`onlinevoting.sql`) to generate tables.
- Ensure the `dash_login` table contains admin login credentials.

### 3. Configure Connection
Edit the database config in `l-logic.php`:
```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "onlinevoting";
$port = 3307; // Use your XAMPP port if different
```

### 4. Run Locally
- Use XAMPP to start Apache and MySQL.
- Access the app at:  
  ```
  http://localhost/Online-Voting-System/dash-login.php
  ```
